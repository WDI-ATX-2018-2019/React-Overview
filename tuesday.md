# Welcoe To React Day 3

### Today we are going to cover AJAX, `fetch()`, `componentDidMount()`, async/await in React!

#### Our learning Objectives will be: 
    1. Makeing Ajax calls with `fetch()` in react
    2. Using Async/Await and or promises for syncronicity in react
    3. Understanding some of the basic Lifecycle Methods
    4. Understanding why and when to use `componentDidMount()`
    5. rendering better UI with lists

If we have time we will do some React review and get even more practice!

```javascript
componendDidMount() {
    const getThings = async () => {
        fetch()
    }
}

```
